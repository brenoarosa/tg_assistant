 * @section lib_compile Library compilation
 *
 * Firstly you need to install some dependencies such as Boost and build tools such as CMake. On Debian-based distibutives you can do it with these commands:
 * @code{.sh}
 * sudo apt-get install g++ make binutils cmake libssl-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-iostreams-dev
 * @endcode
 *
 * To compile the library execute this commands:
 * @code{.sh}
 * cd /path/where/you/have/cloned/the/library/repository
 * cmake .
 * make -j4
 * sudo make install
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section bot_compile Bot compilation
 * With CMake:
 * [Example CMakeLists.txt](samples/echobot/CMakeLists.txt)
 *
 * Without CMake:
 * @code{.sh}
 * g++ telegram_bot.cpp -o telegram_bot --std=c++11 -I/usr/local/include -lTgBot -lboost_system -lboost_iostreams -lssl -lcrypto -lpthread
 * @endcode
 *
 * You can use Docker to build and run your bot. Set the base image of your's Dockerfile to [reo7sp/tgbot-cpp](https://hub.docker.com/r/reo7sp/tgbot-cpp/).
 *
 * @section Samples
 * All samples are located [here](https://github.com/reo7sp/tgbot-cpp/tree/master/samples)
